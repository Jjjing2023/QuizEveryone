Project Objective: The objective of the "Quiz Everyone" project is to develop a web application that empowers educators and administrators to create, share, and manage quizzes effortlessly. The platform will enable users to generate custom quizzes with diverse question types, share them through unique URLs, and collect and analyze participant responses. Ultimately, our aim is to enhance audience engagement, streamline the quiz creation process, and provide insightful feedback to improve the learning experience for both educators and learners.
